Combine graph transformations and Java.
This project has been developed as part of a Bachelor's thesis.

The goal is to add Java based functionality directly to graph transformations and vice-versa.
Using this approach, one could enhance their existing Graph transformation models with Java code.
Or one could treat Java data as a graph and apply graph transformations to it.

This approach relies on annotations to identify the intended graph structure of the Java program and uses annotated user defined methods to manipulate the graph structure.
The graph structure can be manipulated by applying the graph transformation rules defined in [GROOVE](https://github.com/nl-utwente-groove), a general purpose graph transformation tool set.
