JaCoMo is a high-level, solver-independent, Java constraint model for constraint satisfaction problems in the integer domain.
JaCoMo can be used to model constrain satisfaction problems and then solve them using different solver implementations.
Currently, supported solvers are:

- [Choco-solver](https://github.com/chocoteam/choco-solver)
- [OR-Tools](https://github.com/google/or-tools)
