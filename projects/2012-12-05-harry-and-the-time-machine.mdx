Harry and the Time Machine is a Gamemaker game I made together with two peers back in high school.
In the game you control a character called Harry, who is transported back in time through different eras.
Each era you have to retrieve your time machine to travel to the next era.

The game is also playable with two players.
I've ported the original version to Gamemaker Studio 1.4 and made it playable online.
The game and the source code can be found here:
