Graphter Effects is a tool to visualize graphs, with a twist!
Instead of visualizing a graph as a series of dots and arrows, you can use a declarative, prolog-like langauge called Graafvis to create any visualization you want.
For example, a graph describing the game state of wolf, goat and cabbage problem, can be visualized as an image of animals trying to cross the river using a boat.

The tool comes with an editor written in Java and a [manual](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xrlo_s56QIxqgLjw2HdHiRSnCJr1OK8bPbz_EHX7JI0/edit?usp=sharing) and is available on Github.
I've also made a (limited) online environment available to try out the tool.
Both can be found here:
