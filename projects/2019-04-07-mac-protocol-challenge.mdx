Simulate Channel Access Methods and achieve the highest score!
This project has been developed as part of a computer science education research.
It has been used in a pilot with Dutch high-school classes.

During the challenge you simulate several systems that try to communicate with a router on the same wireless network.
For these systems you build the channel access method that determines when this system tries to send information.
When multiple systems try to communicate at the same time they interfere with each other.
The goal is to transmit all the data as fast as possible while dividing the bandwith fairly accross the different systems.

The challenge is available as an online website and the source code is available on Github:
