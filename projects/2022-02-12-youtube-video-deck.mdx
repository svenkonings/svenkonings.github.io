YouTube Video Deck is an alternative way to view your YouTube subscriptions!

To use the deck you need to sign in with Google.
Since the app still has the testing status you need to be manually added to the test user group to be able to sign in.
Please send your Google email to youtubevideodeck@svenkonings.nl if you want to try out the deck!

You can try it out online or view the source code on Github:
