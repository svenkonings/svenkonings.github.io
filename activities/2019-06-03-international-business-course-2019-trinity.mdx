The International Business Course is a week long study trip to an European country with visits to several companies and universities.
For this edition we went to the beautiful city of Dublin, where we visited companies such as Google and Facebook.
I organized this event together with a group of five other people.

Here you can find a backup of the original site used to promote the business course, both as website and as Github archive:
